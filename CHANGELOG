2.5.4 - 03/19/2012
===============================================================================
* Addressed an issue where structs with the same name but from different
  namespaces/packages would conflict.  Now using a package alias to
  disambiguate.

2.5.3 - 03/02/2012
===============================================================================
* Minor bug fix for serviceName name class with.

2.4.0 - 01/03/2012
===============================================================================
* added support for structs with more than 22 fields, which previously was the
  limit as that is the max case-class size in scala.  For structs larger than
  this, instead of using case-classes, normal classes are used but with most of
  the case-class boilerplate support code also generated, allowing these structs
  to be used as if they were case-classes.  The only exception is that there is
  no unapply method; but do you really want to unapply 23+ fields in a match
  statement?

2.3.1 - 11/28/2011
===============================================================================
* thriftProtocolFactory in generated ThriftServer now has
  type of TProtocolFactory, so you can override it with other
  protocol factories.


2.3.0 - 11/24/2011
===============================================================================
* You can now override serverBuilder in ThriftServer to provide
  additional server configuration
* The protocol factory to the FinagledClient now has a default
  value of TBinaryProtocol.Factory, which means you don't have
  to specify it when using the default.


2.2.0 - 11/04/2011
===============================================================================
* tracerFactory support in ThriftServer.


2.1.0 - 10/23/2011
===============================================================================
* Support for tracing in server.


2.0.2
===============================================================================
* fixes a bug in which namespace mapping was not applied
  recursively to included documents.


2.0.1
===============================================================================
* fixes a bug in which qualified service names from imported
  thrift files were not resolved properly.


2.0.0
===============================================================================
* fixes a bug with enum in which the first value was wrong.


1.1.1 - 8/24/2011
===============================================================================
* scrooge-runtime-1.0.1
* Each thrift struct companion object now extends ThriftStructCodec
* Correctly resolving enum constants and Const values.
* Title-casing enum value names.
* Added support for namespace renaming from the command line.
